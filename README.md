# esp-stub-lib

This project is experimental and not yet ready for production use.

## Supported Targets

- ESP8266
- ESP32
- ESP32-S2
- ESP32-S3
- ESP32-C2
- ESP32-C3
- ESP32-C5
- ESP32-C6
- ESP32-C61
- ESP32-H2
- ESP32-H21
- ESP32-H4
- ESP32-P4 (including P4-rev1)
- ESP32-S31

## How to use

The library provides a simple interface for creating stubs that can be loaded onto ESP chips.

A complete example project is provided in the [example](example/) directory. It demonstrates:
- Basic stub implementation
- Flash operations
- Target-specific configurations
- Build system integration

See the [example README](example/README.md) for build instructions.

## Function Naming Conventions

Functions that contain `rominit` (e.g., `stub_target_uart_rominit_intr_attach`) require ROM preinitialization by entering download mode to work correctly. These functions are simplified compared to full implementation and expect some initialization done by ROM. They should only be called in contexts where the ROM download mode has been entered.

## Code Conventions

**Include style:** Use angle brackets for project and library headers so that [.clang-format](.clang-format) can sort and group them correctly:

- **`#include <esp-stub-lib/...>`** — public API
- **`#include <target/...>`** — internal target interface
- **`#include <private/...>`** — internal private headers
- **`#include <system_header.h>`** — system/C library headers

Use quoted includes **`#include "..."`** only for truly local headers (e.g. in the same directory). Quoted includes are treated as “internal” and sorted last; using `""` for project headers breaks the intended include order and is easy to miss in review.

## Project Structure

The library uses a three-layer architecture to eliminate circular dependencies and maximize code reuse:

```
esp-stub-lib/
├── include/esp-stub-lib/         # Public API - used by library clients
│   ├── flash.h                   # (stub_lib_flash_init, stub_lib_flash_read, etc.)

        │   ├── uart.c

```

**Dependency Flow:**
```
Public API (include/esp-stub-lib/)  ← Library clients use this
    ↓
Implementation (src/)
    ↓
Common (generic implementations with weak functions)
    ↓
Target (overridden weak functions for target-specific implementations)
    ↓
Base (interface headers only - serves both common and target)
```

**Layer Purposes:**
- **include/esp-stub-lib/**: Public API for library clients (e.g., `stub_lib_flash_init()`)
- **src/**: Implementation layer that uses the target abstraction below
- **base/**: Internal interface layer - shared by both common and target implementations
  - `target/`: Internal API between common/target layers (e.g., `stub_target_flash_init()`)
  - `private/`: Internal headers to be used from target implementations. (e.g., `esp_rom_spiflash_read()`)
- **common/**: Provides reusable weak implementations that work across targets
- **target/esp32***: Target-specific constants (`soc.h`) and strong function overrides when needed

> **Note**: Library clients should only include headers from `include/esp-stub-lib/`. The `src/target/base/` folder (both `target/` and `private/`) contains internal implementation details used by the library itself.
